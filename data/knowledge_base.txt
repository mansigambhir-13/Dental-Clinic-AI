Dental Cleaning and Preventive Care
Regular dental cleanings are essential for maintaining oral health. During a cleaning, our hygienist removes plaque and tartar buildup, polishes teeth, and applies fluoride treatment. We recommend cleanings every six months to prevent cavities and gum disease.

Tooth Fillings and Restorative Procedures
When cavities develop, we use tooth-colored composite fillings that blend naturally with your teeth. The procedure involves removing decayed tooth material and filling the space with durable composite resin. Most fillings can be completed in a single visit.

Root Canal Treatment
Root canal therapy saves infected or severely decayed teeth. The procedure involves removing infected pulp from inside the tooth, cleaning and disinfecting the root canals, and sealing them. A crown is usually placed afterward to protect the tooth.

Dental Crowns and Bridges
Crowns are caps that cover damaged teeth to restore their shape, size, and function. Bridges replace missing teeth by anchoring artificial teeth to adjacent natural teeth. Both procedures typically require two visits and provide long-lasting results.

Teeth Whitening Procedures
Professional teeth whitening can brighten your smile by several shades. In-office treatments use stronger bleaching agents and special lights for immediate results. Take-home kits provide gradual whitening over 1-2 weeks.

Gum Disease Treatment
Gum disease ranges from mild gingivitis to severe periodontitis. Early stages can be treated with deep cleaning (scaling and root planing). Advanced cases may require surgical intervention. Regular maintenance is crucial for preventing recurrence.

Dental Emergency Care
Dental emergencies include severe toothaches, knocked-out teeth, broken teeth, and lost fillings. For knocked-out teeth, time is critical - see a dentist within an hour for the best chance of saving the tooth. Rinse gently and keep the tooth moist.

Orthodontic Treatment Options
We offer traditional braces and clear aligners to straighten teeth and correct bite issues. Treatment typically takes 1-3 years depending on the complexity of the case. Regular adjustments are necessary for optimal results.

Oral Surgery Procedures
Common oral surgeries include tooth extractions, wisdom tooth removal, and dental implant placement. Most procedures are performed under local anesthesia. Recovery time varies from a few days to several weeks depending on the complexity.

Pediatric Dental Care
Children should have their first dental visit by age one or within six months of their first tooth appearing. We provide gentle, age-appropriate care including cleanings, fluoride treatments, and sealants to prevent cavities.

Dental Implants
Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed in the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. They provide a stable foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures. The process typically takes 3-6 months for complete healing and integration.

TMJ Disorder Treatment
Temporomandibular joint disorders can cause jaw pain, clicking, and difficulty opening the mouth. Treatment options include night guards, physical therapy, medications, and in severe cases, surgery. Early intervention often prevents worsening symptoms.
